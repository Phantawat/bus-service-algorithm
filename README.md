# Description

This project aims to develop a comprehensive Shuttle Bus Service Route Planner for Kasetsart University, integrating graph theory algorithms to provide users with optimal bus routes and schedules within the campus. The application allows users to select a starting point and destination, computes the shortest route using graph vertices. In case there are multiple routes available, the application automatically selects the shortest route by distance.

# Dataset Information
Shuttle Bus Lines: 4 lines, but only 3 lines are used depending on the current situation. Bus Stops: Compose of 3 shuttle bus lines, with Line 1 containing 23 stops, Line 3 containing 25 stops, and Special Line containing 3 stops. Dataset Source: Kasetsart University Car Service Routes

Columns Used for Analysis:

Distance for Line 1 (Km) Distance for Line 3 (Km) Distance for Special Line (Km) Distance between 2 Stations (Km) Time Between 2 Station Line 1 (mins)
